        # Obviously, the methods needed here will change a little bit as a result.
        #   (perhaps there will be a 'generate_preliminary sequence', then a generate exact parameters method..

        # dictionaries to hold the series of information over time. 
        #  In the end - IN ANOTHER PROGRAM - we will write these parameters into a database. Here, all we have to do is
        # generate the parameters. Please add other methods as needed .... (is there is one per atmosphere component?)
